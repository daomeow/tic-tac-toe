## Description
- The player who is the fox, will always go first
- Players alternate adding their tokens on the board until either player has three in a row [horizontally, vertically, or diagonally]
- The winner of that round will receive one point
- If there is no winner, by the 9th turn, it will be considered a draw
- **The game will reset itself 3 second** after there is a winner or it ends in a draw
